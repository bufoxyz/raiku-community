<h1>Raiku, explained plainly</h1>

<p>
<strong>Raiku</strong> is not trying to make Solana faster.
Solana is already fast.
</p>

<p>
Raiku exists because speed without execution certainty
breaks real-world systems.
</p>

<p>
This site is a community-written explanation of Raiku,
focused on coordination, predictability, and execution guarantees —
not marketing narratives.
