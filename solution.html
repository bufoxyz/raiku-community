<h1>What Raiku changes</h1>

<p>
Raiku introduces a coordination layer on top of Solana.
</p>

<p>
Instead of hoping a transaction lands in a block,
Raiku allows blockspace to be scheduled and reserved ahead of execution.
</p>

<p>
This makes execution deterministic:
applications can plan behavior instead of retrying blindly.
</p>

<p>
Raiku does not replace Solana.
It coordinates how Solana’s blockspace is used.
