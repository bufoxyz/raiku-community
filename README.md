# Raiku Community Site

This repository hosts a community-written website explaining Raiku
from an execution and coordination perspective.

This is NOT an official Raiku website.

Goal:
- clarity over hype
- coordination over marketing
- execution certainty over narratives

Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
