<h1>The actual problem on Solana</h1>

<p>
Solana performs extremely well in benchmarks.
But under congestion, transaction execution becomes unreliable.
</p>

<p>
Users experience failed transactions, retries, and unpredictable ordering.
For casual users this is annoying.
For traders, bots, and institutions, it is unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
Paying higher fees does not solve coordination.
It only turns execution into a probabilistic game.
